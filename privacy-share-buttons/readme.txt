Enables the well-known "Share this" buttons for different social networks, but with respect toward's your user privacy and data.

== Description ==
A simple interface to panzi [SocialSharePrivacy](https://github.com/panzi/SocialSharePrivacy) jQuery plugin.

The plugin offers the possibility of showing in posts (and optionally pages) buttons for sharing content to
a number of external services like Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, etc..
These buttons are dummy-button by default, and only after explicit action by the visitor
they are activated and become the real buttons. This allows to give control to the single visitor if he wants to send 
sensible personal information to third-parties sites, and thus providing a nice compromise between privacy and social sharing.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `privacy-share-buttons` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to the configuration page of the plugins to choose which buttons to show (and where)
